Complete documentation of the CLAUDE.md system:
- Architecture (root, knowledge, local files)
- OPEV(r+) workflow
- Usage patterns
- Principles and benefits

## How This System Works

### File Types

1. **Root `/CLAUDE.md`**
   - Core instructions for entire project
   - High-level workflow guidelines

2. **Knowledge Base `.claude/knowledge/<topic>/<name>.md`**
   - Organized permanent learnings
   - Reference material

3. **Local `<directory>/CLAUDE.md`**
   - Working memory for specific areas
   - Planning canvas
   - Define files before creating them

### Workflow: OPEV(r+)

**O - Observe**: Gather context from user, web, other sources
**P - Plan**: Create local CLAUDE.md, document info, define structure
**E - Execute**: Generate actual files based on CLAUDE.md plan
**V - Verify**: Test implementation
**(r+) - Report & Iterate**: Communicate and repeat

### Key Principle

**CLAUDE.md as Planning Canvas**:
- Define directory structure in CLAUDE.md first
- Define files in CLAUDE.md before creating them
- Use CLAUDE.md to organize thoughts and plans
- Generate reality from CLAUDE.md definitions

## Meta Note

This CLAUDE.md file is itself an example of the system in action!
