# AGENTS.md — Hadosh Academy Website (Repo Rules)

Scope: this repository (`github-page-hadosh-academy/`).

## What This Repo Is

A static website (HTML/CSS/JS) that serves as the Academy “front door” and public narrative.

## Collaboration Rules

- Planning-first: do not implement UI/architecture changes without explicit agreement on scope and messaging.
- Language-first: optimize for non-technical professionals; avoid jargon unless taught.
- Accuracy: do not claim features that are not yet implemented in the Template Agent.

## Repo Hygiene

- Treat this as a separate git repo (confirm `git status` before committing).
- Keep changes minimal and reversible.
- Commit messages must include `codex`.
