# Landing Page - Working Memory

## Purpose

This CLAUDE.md serves as working memory for developing content for the landing page (`index.html`).

## Current Phase: OBSERVE (Knowledge Gathering)

**Status**: Absorbing context and requirements
**Date**: 2025-11-08
**Branch**: `claude/landing-page-content-011CUuqJn9qBHTemVAYhcAzo`

---

## CRITICAL: Compartmentalization

**Focus**: Landing page ONLY (`index.html`)
- Do NOT work on other pages (bio, template-agent, agents)
- Do NOT change structure or styling
- ONLY replace placeholder content with actual content

---

## Course Context (from User)

### Course Name
**Claude Code Engineering**

### Course Format
- **Cohort size**: 10-15 students
- **Frequency**: Monthly cohorts
- **Starting point**: Template agent

### What Students Learn

1. **The Template Agent**
   - Base starting point for all students
   - Has `.claude/` brain structure

2. **Design Patterns for Control**
   Students learn control mechanisms for their agents:
   - **Instructions** - How to define agent behavior
   - **Tools** - How to add capabilities
   - **Hooks** - How to enforce patterns
   - **Other control forms** - Additional mechanisms

3. **Learning Process**
   - Study the pattern on the template agent
   - Design their own customized behavior
   - Ask the agent to implement their design
   - Result: Customized agent with unique behavior

### Key Concept
**All agents are Claude Code agents with `.claude/` brains**
- Each agent has its own repository
- Each agent has `.claude/` directory structure
- Students learn to "build the brain"

## Assets Analysis

**Status**: ⚠️ No images found in assets/images/

**Location**: `assets/images/`

**Investigation Results** (2025-11-08):
- ✅ Directory exists: `/home/user/hadi-nayebi.github.io/assets/images/`
- ❌ No image files found in directory (empty)
- ❌ No image files found in parent `assets/` directory
- ❌ No image files found in project root
- ✅ Directory structure is ready to receive assets

**Search performed**:
- Searched for common image formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, SVG, WEBP
- Checked assets/images/, assets/, and project root
- Result: No image files present

**Implication for Landing Page**:
- Cannot yet determine visual style from actual assets
- Need to wait for images to be uploaded before planning image integration
- Can proceed with text content development independently
- Image placement strategy will need to be determined after assets arrive

**What we're expecting** (based on context):
- Hero background or illustration
- Course branding/logo
- Visual representations of the template agent concept
- Icons for the three learning pillars (Instructions, Tools, Hooks)
- Possibly: Screenshots or diagrams of the agent structure
- Possibly: Visual metaphors for the ".claude/ brain" concept

## Questions to Clarify (Before Implementation)

### About the Landing Page Content

**Hero Section**:
- [ ] Course title: "Claude Code Engineering" - confirmed?
- [ ] Tagline: What's the hook? What feeling should it convey?
- [ ] Call-to-action: What should the main button say and do?

**Course Overview**:
- [ ] What are the 3 key learning outcomes to highlight?
- [ ] How technical should the language be?
- [ ] What's the target audience background? (developers, no-code, mixed?)

**Value Proposition**:
- [ ] Why take this course vs. learning on your own?
- [ ] What's unique about the approach?
- [ ] What will students be able to do after?

**Cohort Information**:
- [ ] When does next cohort start?
- [ ] How long is the course?
- [ ] Price/cost information?
- [ ] How to enroll? (link, email, form?)

**Instructor/About**:
- [ ] Should landing page mention instructor?
- [ ] Brief intro or link to bio page?

**Social Proof/Trust**:
- [ ] Any testimonials?
- [ ] Previous cohort results?
- [ ] Showcase example projects?

## Implementation Plan (To Be Defined After Clarification)

### Files to Modify
- `index.html` - Replace placeholders with actual content

### Files NOT to Touch
- `bio.html` - Separate compartment
- `template-agent.html` - Separate compartment
- `agents/*.html` - Separate compartment
- CSS files - Structure phase complete, no styling changes
- Navigation structure - Already defined

---

## Design Constraints (Must Maintain)

From `assets/CLAUDE.md` and root `CLAUDE.md`:
- ✅ Dark glassy space aesthetic
- ✅ "Easy, smooth, and relaxed" feeling
- ✅ Generous whitespace
- ✅ Placeholder format `[Description]` until replaced
- ✅ No changes to CSS or structure
- ✅ Mobile-responsive (already implemented)

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create branch
2. ✅ Create local CLAUDE.md (this file)
3. ✅ Check assets/images/ directory (RESULT: Empty - no images uploaded yet)
4. ⏸️ **WAITING** for user to upload assets to assets/images/
5. ⏳ Review assets when available and absorb visual context
6. ⏳ Ask clarifying questions about content
7. ⏳ Get crystal clear image of landing page vision
8. ⏳ Document implementation plan in this CLAUDE.md
9. ⏳ THEN implement content changes to index.html
10. ⏳ Verify and test
11. ⏳ Commit and push

**Current Blocker**: No assets available to analyze. Two options:
- Option A: Wait for images to be uploaded, then proceed with complete vision
- Option B: Proceed with text content development now, integrate images later

## Notes

**Current Status of index.html**:
- Structure complete with placeholder text
- Sections: Hero, Course Overview (3 cards), Template Agent Intro, Agent Examples, CTA
- Navigation: Home, Template Agent, Agent Examples, About
- All styling in place, just needs content

**Tone/Voice to Maintain**:
- Approachable, not intimidating
- Clear and straightforward
- Inspiring but realistic
- Technical enough to be credible, simple enough to be welcoming
