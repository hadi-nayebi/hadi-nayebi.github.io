# Landing Page - Working Memory

## Purpose

This CLAUDE.md serves as working memory for developing content for the landing page (`index.html`).

## Current Phase: OBSERVE (Knowledge Gathering)

**Status**: Absorbing context and requirements
**Date**: 2025-11-08
**Branch**: `claude/landing-page-content-011CUuqJn9qBHTemVAYhcAzo`

---

## CRITICAL: Compartmentalization

**Focus**: Landing page ONLY (`index.html`)
- Do NOT work on other pages (bio, template-agent, agents)
- Do NOT change structure or styling
- ONLY replace placeholder content with actual content

---

## Course Context (from User)

### Course Name
**Claude Code Engineering**

### Course Format
- **Cohort size**: 10-15 students
- **Frequency**: Monthly cohorts
- **Starting point**: Template agent

### What Students Learn

1. **The Template Agent**
   - Base starting point for all students
   - Has `.claude/` brain structure

2. **Design Patterns for Control**
   Students learn control mechanisms for their agents:
   - **Instructions** - How to define agent behavior
   - **Tools** - How to add capabilities
   - **Hooks** - How to enforce patterns
   - **Other control forms** - Additional mechanisms

3. **Learning Process**
   - Study the pattern on the template agent
   - Design their own customized behavior
   - Ask the agent to implement their design
   - Result: Customized agent with unique behavior

### Key Concept
**All agents are Claude Code agents with `.claude/` brains**
- Each agent has its own repository
- Each agent has `.claude/` directory structure
- Students learn to "build the brain"

### Branding Insights

**Brand Name Discovery**: "Hadosh Academy"

This reveals important branding context:

- **Hadosh Academy** = Parent brand/organization
- **Claude Code Engineering** = Course name/offering within Hadosh Academy

**Hierarchy**:
```
Hadosh Academy (organization)
  └─ Claude Code Engineering (course)
```

**Implications**:
- Logo should show "Hadosh Academy" branding
- Course title "Claude Code Engineering" should be prominent in hero
- Navigation should include Hadosh Academy logo
- About page should explain Hadosh Academy context

**Brand Identity**:
- Orange/coral color (#FF7F50 approx) = brand primary color
- Asterisk/star symbol = brand icon (suggests: hub, center, radial connections)
- Clean, modern, professional aesthetic
- Playful but credible (construction illustration shows this balance)

---

### Recommended Image Usage

#### Image 1: "Hadosh Academy logo balck background.png"
**Placement**: Navigation bar logo (top-left)
**Rationale**:
- Compact horizontal format perfect for nav
- Already on dark background matching site
- Professional and clean for header
- Provides brand identity on every page

**Implementation**:
```html
<nav class="main-nav">
  <div class="nav-container">
    <a href="index.html" class="logo">
      <img src="assets/images/Hadosh Academy logo balck background.png"
           alt="Hadosh Academy Logo"
           class="logo-image">
    </a>
    <!-- rest of nav -->
  </div>
</nav>
```

---

#### Image 2: "Hadosh academy no background.png"
**Placement**: NOT recommended for current landing page
**Rationale**:
- Transparent background version redundant with Image 1
- Black text not suitable for dark theme (would need CSS inversion)
- Image 1 already serves logo needs
- Could be useful for future light-mode variant or print materials

**Status**: Keep in assets but don't use in initial implementation

---

#### Image 3: "big image of constructors building claude code logo.png"
**Placement**: Hero section background or focal image
**Rationale**:
- PERFECT metaphor for "building your own agent"
- Dark background matches site exactly
- Playful yet professional - balances technical credibility with approachability
- Visually interesting - draws eye and creates memorable impression
- Supports "easy, smooth, relaxed" feeling (construction is tangible, not abstract/intimidating)
- Orange color creates visual continuity with logo

**Two Implementation Options**:

**Option A - Hero Background** (RECOMMENDED):
```html
<section class="hero">
  <div class="hero-background">
    <img src="assets/images/big image of constructors building claude code logo.png"
         alt="Building your Claude Code agent"
         class="hero-bg-image">
  </div>
  <div class="hero-content">
    <div class="hadosh-branding">
      <span class="brand-badge">Hadosh Academy Presents</span>
    </div>
    <h1>Claude Code Engineering</h1>
    <p class="hero-subtitle">Build Your Own AI Agent</p>
    <!-- CTA -->
  </div>
</section>
```

**Option B - Hero Focal Image**:
Place image to the right of hero text in a two-column layout
- Left: Text content
- Right: Construction illustration

**Recommendation**: Option A (background) creates more immersive, modern feel

---

### Integration Strategy with Design System

#### Color Harmony

**Existing Palette**:
```css
--color-space-deep: #0a0e27;
--color-accent-primary: #667eea; (purple)
--color-accent-secondary: #764ba2; (purple)
```

**New Brand Color** (from logo):
```css
--color-brand-orange: #FF7043; (approx)
```

**Strategy**:
1. **Keep purple as primary accent** (buttons, links, glows)
2. **Use orange for brand moments** (logo, brand badges, special callouts)
3. **Don't mix both** - use orange sparingly to avoid color clash
4. **Orange works as "warmth" contrast** to cool purple/blue palette

#### Visual Continuity

The construction illustration reinforces the design philosophy:
- **Building metaphor** = accessible, tangible process
- **Construction workers** = hands-on, learnable skill
- **Dark space background** = matches "dark glassy space" aesthetic
- **Warm lighting on logo** = welcoming, approachable
- **Professional quality** = credible, serious course

---

### File Naming Recommendation

Current filenames have issues:
- "balck" typo
- Spaces in filenames (not best practice)
- Inconsistent capitalization

**Recommended Rename**:
```bash
# Current → Recommended
"Hadosh Academy logo balck background.png" → "hadosh-logo-dark.png"
"Hadosh academy no background.png" → "hadosh-logo-transparent.png"
"big image of constructors building claude code logo.png" → "hero-construction-illustration.png"
```

**Benefits**:
- No spaces (better for web)
- Descriptive and clear
- Lowercase convention
- Purpose-driven naming

---

### Image Optimization Needed

All three images should be optimized before deployment:

1. **Compression**: Reduce file size without quality loss
2. **Format**: Consider WebP with PNG fallback
3. **Responsive versions**: Create multiple sizes for different screen widths
4. **Lazy loading**: Add loading="lazy" for non-critical images

**Tools to use**:
- ImageOptim, TinyPNG, or Squoosh
- Target: <200KB per image for web performance

---

### Next Steps for Image Integration

1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Analyze uploaded images
2. ⏳ **NEXT**: Rename files for web best practices
3. ⏳ **NEXT**: Optimize images (compress, WebP conversion)
4. ⏳ **NEXT**: Update index.html hero section with construction illustration
5. ⏳ **NEXT**: Add Hadosh Academy logo to navigation
6. ⏳ **NEXT**: Create brand badge/label showing "Hadosh Academy Presents"
7. ⏳ **NEXT**: Test responsive behavior of images
8. ⏳ **NEXT**: Add proper alt text for accessibility

## Implementation Plan (To Be Defined After Clarification)

### Files to Modify
- `index.html` - Replace placeholders with actual content

### Files NOT to Touch
- `bio.html` - Separate compartment
- `template-agent.html` - Separate compartment
- `agents/*.html` - Separate compartment
- CSS files - Structure phase complete, no styling changes
- Navigation structure - Already defined

---

## Design Constraints (Must Maintain)

From `assets/CLAUDE.md` and root `CLAUDE.md`:
- ✅ Dark glassy space aesthetic
- ✅ "Easy, smooth, and relaxed" feeling
- ✅ Generous whitespace
- ✅ Placeholder format `[Description]` until replaced
- ✅ No changes to CSS or structure
- ✅ Mobile-responsive (already implemented)

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create branch
2. ✅ Create local CLAUDE.md (this file)
3. ✅ Check assets/images/ directory (RESULT: Empty - no images uploaded yet)
4. ⏸️ **WAITING** for user to upload assets to assets/images/
5. ⏳ Review assets when available and absorb visual context
6. ⏳ Ask clarifying questions about content
7. ⏳ Get crystal clear image of landing page vision
8. ⏳ Document implementation plan in this CLAUDE.md
9. ⏳ THEN implement content changes to index.html
10. ⏳ Verify and test
11. ⏳ Commit and push

**Current Blocker**: No assets available to analyze. Two options:
- Option A: Wait for images to be uploaded, then proceed with complete vision
- Option B: Proceed with text content development now, integrate images later

---

## Notes

**Current Status of index.html**:
- Structure complete with placeholder text
- Sections: Hero, Course Overview (3 cards), Template Agent Intro, Agent Examples, CTA
- Navigation: Home, Template Agent, Agent Examples, About
- All styling in place, just needs content

**Tone/Voice to Maintain**:
- Approachable, not intimidating
- Clear and straightforward
- Inspiring but realistic
- Technical enough to be credible, simple enough to be welcoming
