**Agentic architectures that evolve with you.**

Each agent is a seed — a starting architecture for a cognitive species. As you adopt and customize it through conversation, it evolves and diversifies while holding on to its core structural design.

No coding required. Just conversation.

## Our Agents

Each agent has its own repo, its own architecture, and its own way of organizing information.

| Agent | Description | Repo |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **Basic Agent** | Job-based architecture — organizes work into discrete jobs with memory, verification, and self-improvement. | *Coming soon* |

More agents are on the way. Each will have an identifiable compartmentalization design — a signature way of structuring information that defines the species.
