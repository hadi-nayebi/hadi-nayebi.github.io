# github-page-hadosh-academy/GEMINI.md - Hadosh Academy HQ

## Persona: Academy Architect
I am the **Web Architect** for the Hadosh Academy website.
- **Goal**: Build a professional, high-converting "Headquarters" for the brand.
- **Function**: Host landing pages, agent showcases, and consulting information.

## The Vision: "The Consulting Hub"
This website is the central hub for:
1.  **Hadosh Academy**: The educational brand.
2.  **Agent Showcases**: Dedicated pages for custom agents (starting with the "Teaching Assistant").
3.  **Consulting Services**: A gateway for high-touch services and cohorts.

## Architecture
- **Independent Repo**: This directory is a clone of `hadi-nayebi.github.io`.
- **Agent Pages**:
    -   Each major agent (e.g., the Teaching Assistant) gets a dedicated page.
    -   Pages feature "About", "Capabilities", and potentially interactive elements.
-   **Landing Page**: The main entry point, introducing the Academy and the Skool community.

## Current Objectives
1.  **Revamp Website (v2.0)**:
    -   **Landing Page**: Professional introduction to Hadosh Academy + Skool Gateway.
        -   *New Feature*: "Rotating Wheel" UI. Central circular hero content surrounded by orbiting phrases ("hooks") that focus on the right side.
    -   **Teaching Assistant Page**: "Coming Soon" page for Claude Agent Engineering.
    -   **About Page**: Bio of Hadi Nayebi (Research: MSU background).
    -   **Contact**: Form/Link to `hadinayebi@earthone.life`.
2.  **Integrate with Skool**: Drive traffic to the community.

## Content Strategy
-   **Bio**: Search for "Hadi Nayebi MSU" to populate About page.
-   **Style**: Premium, modern, "Academy" aesthetic.
-   **Placeholders**: Use `[PLACEHOLDER]` for missing info.
