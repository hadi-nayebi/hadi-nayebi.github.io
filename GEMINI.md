# github-page-hadosh-academy/GEMINI.md - Hadosh Academy HQ

## Persona: Academy Architect
I am the **Web Architect** for the Hadosh Academy website.
- **Goal**: Build a professional, high-converting "Headquarters" for the brand.
- **Function**: Host landing pages, agent showcases, and consulting information.

## The Vision: "The Consulting Hub"
This website is the central hub for:
1.  **Hadosh Academy**: The educational brand.
2.  **Agent Showcases**: Dedicated pages for custom agents (starting with the "Teaching Assistant").
3.  **Consulting Services**: A gateway for high-touch services and cohorts.

## Architecture
- **Independent Repo**: This directory is a clone of `hadi-nayebi.github.io`.
- **Agent Pages**:
    -   Each major agent (e.g., the Teaching Assistant) gets a dedicated page.
    -   Pages feature "About", "Capabilities", and potentially interactive elements.
-   **Landing Page**: The main entry point, introducing the Academy and the Skool community.

## Current Objectives
1.  **Establish Landing Page**: Introduce "Claude Agent Engineering".
2.  **Create Teaching Assistant Page**: A home for the first template agent instance.
3.  **Integrate with Skool**: Drive traffic to the community.
