                <p class="hero-description">Agents are not chatbots. They are custom-built systems that use LLMs as
                    engines. Each agent manages its own filesystem, maintains its own memory, and continues working
                    through hook-triggered jobs. The model is the engine — the agent is everything around it.</p>

                    <h3>Basic Agent</h3>
                    <p>A job scheduler agent with hook-triggered jobs. Demonstrates how agents manage their own
                        filesystem and continue working via blocking stop hooks. Your first step into real agent
                        engineering.</p>

                <p>Each agent we release is a "seed" — a starting template that you customize through conversation.
                    No coding required. You talk to the agent, and it adapts its own architecture to fit your
                    needs. More agents will follow, each one tackling a different domain and demonstrating new
                    patterns.</p>
