                    as jobs, and ensures every task is completed before stopping. You customize it through
                    conversation — the agent adapts its own architecture to fit your needs.</p>

                    <p>An agent built around a job-based architecture — it organizes everything it does as jobs,
                        and ensures all work is properly completed before stopping. Customize it through conversation
                        to fit your professional workflow.</p>

                <h2>More Agents Coming</h2>
                <p>Each agent is a reliable seed — a starting template that adapts to your needs through
                    conversation. A lawyer can customize one for client onboarding, a consultant for project
                    management, a researcher for literature reviews. More agents will follow, each one helping
                    professionals scale their skills.</p>
